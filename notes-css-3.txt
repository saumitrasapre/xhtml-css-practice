CSS-NOTES-3:
REFERENCE: CSS INDEX 3

STYLING LINKS:
A hyperlink in css has 4 different states. We can change the properties of each of these states as and when they occur
There is also another parameter that we can adjust which is "text-decoration". By default it is none But we can set it to "underline",and many other things.
Refer here: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-decoration/

1> DEFAULT(link): This state occurs when the user has first visited the website and has never clicked the link.
				  By default it is blue in color and underlined.We can change any of the aspects like color, background-color, font-family, font-width, font-size,etc.
				  
2>VISITED(visited):This state occurs when the user has already visited the website and has clicked the link at least clicked the link once.
				  By default it is purple in color and underlined.We can change any of the aspects like color, background-color, font-family, font-width, font-size,etc.

3>HOVER (hover):  This state occurs when the user hovers his mouse pointer over the link.It occurs irrespective of whether the user has visited the link or not.
				  By default it is not present.We can change any of the aspects like color, background-color, font-family, font-width, font-size,etc.
				 
4>ACTIVE (active): This state occurs when the user clicks the link with his mouse but has not yet released the mouse click.It occurs irrespective of whether
				   the user has visited the link or not.By default it is red in color and underlined.We can change any of the aspects like color,
				   background-color, font-family, font-width, font-size,etc.
Syntax:
a:link{/*adjust properties here*/  <------THIS IS THE DEFAULT STATE
	  }

a:visited{/*adjust properties here*/  <------THIS IS THE VISITED STATE
	  }
	  
a:hover{/*adjust properties here*/  <------THIS IS THE HOVER STATE
	  }

a:active{/*adjust properties here*/  <------THIS IS THE ACTIVE STATE
	  }

STYLING TABLES:
Like any other element that we can style using css, tables work in a similar way.The thing to be remembered is that all the different elements are inherited from
one another. This means that if we style:
1>THE TABLE TAG: Then the entire table will get affected.This means that if we set the table border to something, then it will encompass the entire table 
				 and not the individual cells of the table.Again, if we set the background color to something, then it will ignore the individual cells and just
				 paint the entire interior of the table to that color.

2> THE TR TAG: Then all the rows of the table will get affected, with complete disregard to the individual cells of the rows. For example, if we set the background
				color to say yellow, then all the ROWS will get painted yellow and ther will be a teensy white space separating the different rows (assuming we have
				not given any background color to the table tag).
			
3> THE TD TAG: Then all the individual cells will get affected. For example, if we set a blue dotted border to the td tag, then all the individual cells will have
			   a blue dotted border with a white space separating each of the individual cells.(Assuming that the table tag does not have a background color).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STYLING UNORDERED LISTS:
We have especially considered styling unordered lists because in unordered lists, the elements are listed in filled circular punch-holes as bullet points.
We--as you might have guessed-- can change these bullet holes into some of the predefined bullet types like:
1>Square (a filled box)
2>Circle (an unfilled circle)
3> None (No bullet points)
4>Disc (DEFAULT: filled circle)
This can be done using the "list-style-type" property.Syntax:
ul { list-style-type: square;
	}
OR:
ul {list-style-type: katakana;
	}

Read More about it here: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_list-style-type.asp
All the built-in examples are shown here: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_list-style-type_all

Sometimes, it may also occur that all the default values may not "tickle your feathers". In such a case, you may also use your own custom image as your bullet
point.This can be done using the "list-style-image" property.REMEMBER: In css, while using any image, we must use the keyword "url".This is true in this case
too:
Syntax:
ul {list-style-image: url(mybulletpoint.jpg);
	}
CAUTION:
Consider a scenario where you set the list-style-type to "none". We now expect that the list will indeed have no bullet points -- which it indeed doesnt.
BUT, the text is not automatically skewed to the left once we remove the bullet points.(We shall assume so because the only reason why one might be setting
the list-style-type to "none" is that  one doesn't want the bullet points and just needs the plain text).
This problem occurs because the browser assigns a default padding to the list, and we need to explicitly remove the padding in order for the text to skew to
the left.This can be done by manipulating the "padding" property.
ul{list-style-type: none;
	padding-left: 0px;
	}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STYLING MORE THAN ONE ELEMENTS AT A TIME:
Till now we mentioned each element explicitly and then styled them individually. We may come across scenarios where we may want to style more than one elements
with the same style.(Give them the same background color, or the font-family for example).
This can be quite easily done with the help of a short-hand notation. Just write the elements whose properties you want to alter and separate them with commas.
This can have the following syntax:

element_1, element_2{property_1: value_1;
					 property_2: value_2;
					 }
EXAMPLE:
h2, p {font-family: Impact,charcoal,sans-serif;
		color: blue;
		}
