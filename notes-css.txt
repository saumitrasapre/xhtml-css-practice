CSS-CASCADING STYLE SHEETS

when you comment in CSS, use /* comments */ (similar to c/c++)
when you comment in HTML use <!-- comments -->ï»¿

Before we begin the beautification using css,we need to include a STYLE tag in the HEAD tag.This specifies the browser that we are using css.
The style tag takes an attribute called "type" and we must set it equal to "text/css".
<style type="text/css"> ... </style>
All the css attributes that we write will be included in the above tag.

Another thing to be remembered is that we can change the properties of a wide variety of elements in the webpage by specifying the selector.
The selector is usually the thing that goes into the angular brackets of the xhtml tags.All the changes in the properties go inside the style tag.
The general syntax for changing the properties of elements using css is:
 selector_name {property1:value1;
				property2:value2;
				property3:value3;
				}
For example suppose we have a paragraph like:
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
 ^This is the selector(ie the value between the angular brackets)
 In order to change the properties of all the paragraphs in the webpage we write the following inside the style tag:
 
 p {color:blue;----->Sets the color to blue
	font-family:arial;------>Changes the font to arial
	}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	COLORS:
	We can also use RGB values to specify the color of our text. If we want to build a basic website, the specifying the names of the colors will suffice.
	But if we want some specific color the we can use the RGB/ HEX values.The colors can be picked from any color picker website:
	https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html
	The RGB can be specified by preceding the value by a '#' sign.
	eg. p {color: red;
			/*OR: color: #rgb_value;*/
		  }
		  ^Changes the color of all the paragraphs in our html document to red;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	LINE HEIGHT:
	We can adjust the space between different lines of the paragraph.This can be done by using the "line-height" property.The line height by default is
	100%.But we can increase (e.g 150%) or decrease it(e.g. 50%).The syntax is as follows:
	p {line-height: 150%;
		}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		
	FONT WEIGHT AND FONT STYLE:
	We know that we can bold, italicize and underline text using ordinary xhtml tags.We can also do the same using css.The font weight property decides the
	degree of boldness of a given font. Again , we can also specify the boldness using simple numerical values.The default value is 400. Increasing the value will
	make the font more bolder and vice versa.Or, we can also specify text values like "normal(400)", "bold(700)", "bolder(bolder than inherited font weight)",
	"lighter(lighter than inherited font weight)" Syntax:
	p {font-weight:900;
		}
		OR:
	p  {font-weight:bold;
		}
		
		In order to italicize the text, we use the "font-style" property. We simply specify the keyword "italic" and the font becomes italic.There are several
		keywords associated with "font-style".Syntax:
		p {font-style: italic;
			}
			In order to underline text, we use  the "text-decoration" property. Under this we can specify whether we want the text to be "underline","overline"
			"line-through" etc.
		p{text-decoration: underline green wavy;
			}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		TEXT ALIGN AND TEXT INDENT:
		We can also align text in css so that it is aligned to the left(ie the default), the right, or the center. This can be done using the text align property.
		We just specify the keyword "left", "right" or "center" in order to change the alignment of the different elements of the website.
		Syntax:
		p { text-align:center;
			}
		In order to indent the paragraph at the beginning, we can use the text-indent property. We can either specify a percentage of the screen size or we can
		also specify the no of pixels.Syntax:
		p {text-indent:25px;
		 }
		 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		 
		BACKGROUND COLOR:
		If we want to change the background color of our website, we need to change the properties of the body segment. The required keyword for this is:
		"background-color".Similar to color attribute we can either specify textual values or we can also specify the RGB values.Syntax:
		body {background-color:yellow;
			  }
		If we want to change the color of our whole text in the body, then we use the color tag in the body.If we have already specifid some color to a particular
		paragraph in the body, then it will remain the same.Syntax:
		body {color:blue;
			 }
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			 
		BACKGROUND IMAGES:
		CAUTION: READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY!
		Now we come to the interesting part-- adding background images using css.Now adding the background images is very similar to how we add images
		in xhtml. Before we add an image, we need to ensure that the image file is in our working directory,(or we can also specify a path if we want to).
		Since we want to add a background image to the entire webpage, we need to modify the body tag.
		The syntax for adding a background image is:
		body {background-image: url(insert_image_source_here);
			 }
		The url tag is very important, otherwise the image will never get added.
		CAUTION 1:By default when we add an image, it gets mosiaced onto the entire page. So, the page will look like a collection of tiles with our specified image.
				In order to remove this repetiton, we modify another property of the body called "background-repeat" and set it to "no-repeat".
				Syntax:
				body {background-image: url(cat.jpg);
					  background-repeat:no-repeat;
					  }
		CAUTION 2: Sometimes we can also have an image which we want to repeat, but only horizontally(ie along the x-axis) or only vertically(ie along y-axis).
					This problem can be solved by setting the "background-repeat" property to "repeat-x"( for repeating an image horizontally) or to "repeat-y"
					(for repeating an image vertically).
					Syntax:
					body {background-image: url(cat.jpg);
						  background-repeat: repeat-x;
						  }
					OR:
					body {background-image: url(cat.jpg);
						  background-repeat: repeat-y;
						  }
		CAUTION 3: Sometimes we also have to position an image to a particular location rather than keeping it at its default location.This can be done by
					modifying another property called "background-position".This property takes 2 parameters instead of 1. They are written one after the other
					with a space in between. The first parameter is the x-distance ie how far to the left do you want the image to be(either in percentages or pixels). The second parameter is the 
					y-distance ie how far down do you want the image to be(either in percentages or pixels).
					Syntax:
					body {background-image: url(cat.jpg);
						  background-repeat:no-repeat;
						  background-position:25px 50px;
						  }
		CAUTION 4: Sometimes we want the background image to cover a specific percentage of the screen, or to cover the entire screen.This can be made possible
				   by using the "background-size" property. We can specify the percentage as per our requirement here and specify 100% to cover the entire screen.
				   Syntax:
				   body {background-image: url(cat.jpg);
						 background-repeat: no-repeat;
						 background-size: 100%;
						 }
		CAUTION 5: Sometimes we need to set a particular background to our website which must remain fixed and must not scroll whenever the page ends. This can
					be achieved using the "background-attachment" property. The background attachment property can have 3 different values:
					a> Fixed: Background image will not scroll along with the page.
					b> Scroll: Background image will not scroll along with the page.
					c> Inherit: Background image will have the same property as that of the parent tag.
