CSS-NOTES-2:


THE CSS BOX MODEL:
(REFER CSS INDEX 2 IN THIS DIRECTORY)
PADDING:
It is a very important aspect of designing elements in your website in detail. In order to observe padding closely, change the background color of any text to
any color other than the default white.We see that a strip is formed around the text that spans the entire width of the screen.The space between the BORDER OF THIS
STRIP AND THE TEXT is called PADDING.It is much similar to cellpadding in tables.So, remember: SPACE BETWEEN BORDER OF STRIP AND THE TEXT IS CALLED PADDING.
We can easily manipulate padding ON ALL SIDES by using the "padding" property.It takes in the number of pixels or can also take in the percentage of screen size.
Syntax:
h2 {background-color: yellow;---->For clear visibility of the strip.
	padding:20px;
	}
CAUTION:
We can also manipulate the padding on individual sides by using the "padding-top", "padding-left", "padding-right", "padding-bottom" properties.They can also accept
pixels or percnetages of screen size.Syntax:
h2 {background-color: yellow;---->For clear visibility of the strip.
	padding-left:20px;
	padding-top:60px;
	}
The above code will add padding of 20px from left and a padding of 60px from top.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BORDER:
It is another thing that you need to consider while designing webpages.The border as the name suggests-- IS THE LINE SURROUNDING THE STRIP THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED
PREVIOUSLY.In order to modify borders, WE NEED TO ALWAYS SPECIFY 3 PROPERTIES-- otherwise the BORDER WILL NOT BE CREATED.They are:
1>"border-size"--In pixels.It is essentially the weight of the border.We can specify it in either pixels or percentages.
2>"border-color"--As with colors, we can either specify the color textually or by using the RGB values.
3>"border-style"-- We can specify the type of borders like -- "dashed" or "dotted".All the styles can be found here:https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp
Syntax:
h2 {background-color:orange;---->For clear visibility of the strip.
	border-color:red;
	border-width:4%;
	border-style:solid;
	}
CAUTION -- SHORTHAND NOTATION:
Instead of specifying the border each time using 3 different keywords, we can simply use a shorthand notation whose syntax is as follows:
border : border_color_here    border_size_here     border_style_here;   <---The order is not important.
Example:
h2 {border : red 10px dotted;
	}
CAUTION -- INDIVIDUAL BORDERS:
Instead of modifying the entire border, we can also change borders on each individual side.This can be done using "border-top", "border-left",
"border-right", "border-bottom" properties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARGIN:
This is the last aspect of the "CSS BOX MODEL". Consider 2 paragraphs:
<p> HELLO THERE!</p>
<p>F*ck You!></p>
By default, these paragraphs will be displayed with a little space between them. THIS SPACE IS CALLED MARGIN. Again let us highlight these paragraphs using
"background-color" (say orange). We shall now see 2 orange colored strips surrounding these paragraphs. THE SPACING IN BETWEEN THESE STRIPS IS CALLED "MARGIN".
We can adjust the overall margin by using the "margin" property.(IT IS 10 PX BY DEFAULT).It takes either pixels or percentages as parameters.
Syntax:
p {margin: 4px;
   }
  This shall separate all paragraphs on your webpage by 4 pixels.
  CAUTION -- INDIVIDUAL MARGINS:
  Instead of modifying the entire margin on all sides, we can also change borders on each individual side.This can be done using "margin-top", "margin-left",
"margin-right", "margin-bottom" properties.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
WIDTH AND HEIGHT:
WIDTH:
Width is the space from left to right that the element takes up on the page. Padding is the space around the content of the element (all four sides)
but inside of the border.
Using a larger width you would just stretch the element out further and the height would not change.
Using a larger padding could make the element have a larger scale which would adjust both the width and the height.

HEIGHT:
Both height and padding inherently control the height of an element.

Use height when you need a fixed container height.
PRO: Useful for when you don't want the container to stretch vertically.
CON:
o Becomes brittle as you change properties like font-size, margin, padding, etc.
o Increasing sizes can cause contents to hide or overflow.
o Changing a font-size, for example, can cause a cascade change (you have to also change the margins/padding, or size properties of sibling/child elements).

Use padding when you don't need a fixed container height, but want to add whitespace.
PRO: Easier to change font-sizes, margins, paddings, and add additional content to the container that may increase the container's vertical size.
CON:
o Adding content/increasing size properties will cause the container to stretch vertically, which is undesirable in some scenarios.
o Not good for scenarios where vertical space is limited or needs to be controlled.
